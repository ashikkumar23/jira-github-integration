# Jira GitHub Integration

This repository demonstrates a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for integrating Jira with GitHub Actions. The primary goal is to automate the creation of Jira bug tickets whenever a GitHub issue is labeled as `bug`.

---

## üõ† Features
- Automatically sync GitHub issues labeled as `bug` to Jira as bug tickets.
- Map issue details (e.g., title, description, reporter) directly into Jira tickets.
- Leverages **GitHub Actions** for seamless workflow automation.
- Provides a clear audit trail with links back to the original GitHub issue.

## üîß Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **Jira Account**: Access to a Jira instance with admin rights to a project.
2. **GitHub Repository**: A repository where you have admin permissions to set up Actions.
3. **API Token**: A Jira API token for authentication. [Learn how to generate one](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html).
4. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - `JIRA_BASE_URL`: Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`).
   - `JIRA_USER_EMAIL`: The email address associated with your Jira account.
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Your Jira API token.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashikkumar23/jira-github-integration.git
cd jira-github-integration
```

### 2. Configure Secrets
Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**, and add the following secrets:
- `JIRA_BASE_URL`
- `JIRA_USER_EMAIL`
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

### 3. Update the Workflow File
The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/jira-integration.yml`. Ensure the following is set:
- Replace `JGI` with your Jira project key.
- Adjust other parameters if needed.

### 4. Test the Workflow
- Create a new issue in the repository.
- Add the `bug` label to the issue.
- Check your Jira project for a new bug ticket.

---

## üöÄ How It Works
1. When you add the `bug` label to a GitHub issue, the workflow is triggered.
2. The workflow uses the [Atlassian Jira Login Action](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-login) to login to Jira.
3. The workflow uses the [Atlassian Jira Create Action](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-create) to create a bug ticket in Jira.
4. The issue details (title, description, reporter, and URL) are mapped to the Jira ticket.

## üìù Example Workflow File

The following is the GitHub Actions workflow file used in this project:

```yaml name=.github/workflows/jira-integration.yml
name: Create Jira Issue on Label

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled

jobs:
  create-jira-issue:
    if: contains(github.event.label.name, 'bug') # Trigger only when the 'bug' label is added
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Login to Jira
        uses: atlassian/gajira-login@v3
        env:
          JIRA_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_BASE_URL }} # The base URL of your Jira instance
          JIRA_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_USER_EMAIL }} # The email associated with your Jira user
          JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }} # The API token for Jira

      - name: Create Jira Issue
        uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v3
        with:
          project: JGI # The Jira project key where the issue should be created
          issuetype: Bug # The type of issue to create
          summary: ${{ github.event.issue.title }} # The title of the issue from GitHub
          description: |
            **Reporter:** ${{ github.actor }}
            
            **Issue URL:** ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}
            
            **Description:** ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
```
